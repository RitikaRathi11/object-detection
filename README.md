# object-detection
This project aims to do real-time object detection through a laptop camera or webcam using OpenCV and MobileNetSSD. The idea is to loop over each frame of the video stream, detect objects like person, chair, dog, etc. and bound each detection in a box. This project will help you to identify the object that will be recorded by the camera .The output which we will get will detect the position of the object with the name of the object along with the percentage of similarity with the object. Project will be able to detect objects as well as identify the object along with the percentage of similarity . Project will be fully functional and ready to be deployed and can be implemented in real world scenario. Real time object detection is a vast, vibrant and complex area of computer vision. If there is a single object to be detected in an image, it is known as Image Localization and if there are multiple objects in an image, then it is Object Detection. This detects the semantic objects of a class in digital images and videos. The applications of real time object detection include tracking objects, video surveillance, pedestrian detection, people counting, self-driving cars, face detection, ball tracking in sports and many more.
