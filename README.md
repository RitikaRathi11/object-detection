# Object-detection
This project aims to do real-time object detection through a laptop camera or webcam using OpenCV and MobileNetSSD. The idea is to loop over each frame of the video stream, detect objects like person, chair, dog, etc. and bound each detection in a box. This project will help you to identify the object that will be recorded by the camera .The output which we will get will detect the position of the object with the name of the object along with the percentage of similarity with the object. Project will be able to detect objects as well as identify the object along with the percentage of similarity . Project will be fully functional and ready to be deployed and can be implemented in real world scenario. Real time object detection is a vast, vibrant and complex area of computer vision. If there is a single object to be detected in an image, it is known as Image Localization and if there are multiple objects in an image, then it is Object Detection. This detects the semantic objects of a class in digital images and videos. The applications of real time object detection include tracking objects, video surveillance, pedestrian detection, people counting, self-driving cars, face detection, ball tracking in sports and many more.

Tools / Technology Required:
Python, TensorFlow, Open CV

# ABSTRACT
Real-time item detection and identification are the focus of the project. Using the Open CV package and pre-trained Tensor flow, it will be developed in Python. SSD is the algorithm in use.
A single convolutional neural network is used in the SSD, sometimes referred to as Single Shot Detector. It functions in conjunction with the bounding boxes and extracted characteristics. For constructing default bounding boxes around the observed objects, SSD supports more aspect ratios. SSD enclosures can more precisely and tightly fit around the objects.
So, we are using a pre-trained deep learning architecture based on Tensor Flow for this project.
We must use J processes for picture segmentation, image detection, and identification in order to complete the project.
We categorise or simply identify the object in the image when performing image identification for static, animated, and interactive Python visualisations.
The project will then be further coded utilising SSD Mobile Net VJ and Tensor Flow Frozen Model, and at its conclusion, we will be able to recognise and categorise static images, mp4 videos, as well as through webcams.
We will demonstrate the study and use of Real-Time Object detection utilising SSD, one of the quickest object detection algorithms, with the aid of this project. The project's objective is to evaluate various models' expertise in this field.
. which we are doing using the Picture Net dataset and the Mobile Net deep learning 
method.
In object detection, we merely identify the region of the image where an object is visible. We use Mobile Net and SSD for detection.
It is the separation of the foreground and background in an image.
We used the Anaconda Package and Jupiter Notebook as our development environments for this solution. We also needed the Open CV library, which is installed using the pip command, and the matplot library 

# Conclusion
Using SSD, we can quickly detect objects in this project (single Shot Detector). It helps with the quickest identification of specific visual elements.
Through the use of Single Shot Multi-Box Detector, we are able to identify multiple items concurrently in real time. We have shown that the widely used fully convolutional neural networks may be applied to Real-Time Object Detection systems.
The networks were trained on a low-cost GPU using the MSCOCO dataset in order to increase the accuracy of the objects recognised by increasing the probability of the objects discovered. The model's performance was then assessed. In terms of object localization, SSD fared better than Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN.
Ultimately, we are able to use MobilNet v1 to perform Real-Time Object Detection utilising SSD, which is quicker and more effective than previous object detection techniques.

# FUTURE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The project's goal is to create an object recognition system that can identify the 2-D and 3-D objects in a photograph. By improving the global or local properties, Object Detection systems' efficiency can be raised even more. The colour data is ignored in the proposed Object Detection approach, which only uses greyscale images. The colour information from the photographs can be utilised to more accurately identify objects because colour is so essential in robotics. Moreover, a built-in night vision option can be added to tracking devices and CCTV cameras. Due to its extensive coverage and different viewing angles for the tracked objects, multiview tracking can be used to overcome the aforementioned limitations and make the systems completely autonomous.
